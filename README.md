#### Technical Test - Frontend Developer

# Fixing and Improving an Angular Component

## Context

This test is based on the scenario where you need to fix and improve legacy code. The component provides a form that suggests existing users thanks to autocompletion. Assume that this component lives in a library of components inside a complex app.

## Tasks

* BUG: The selected user doesn't work anymore
* Call the list of customer with an HTTP request to `http://localhost:4200/customers.json`
* Improve the quality of the component's code
* Write tests relative to the component
* Use a pull request to suggest your solution

_Note: Don't hesitate to use RxJS and TypeScript features where you see fit._

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
